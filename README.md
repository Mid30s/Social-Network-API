## Description

The Social Network API project aimed to create a robust backend infrastructure for a social media application, enabling users to interact with each other through thoughts, reactions, and friend connections. The project employed a RESTful API architecture using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB as the core technologies.

Node.js was chosen as the runtime environment to build the server-side of the application, offering fast and scalable performance. Express was utilized as the web application framework to simplify the development of the API endpoints, routing, and middleware integration. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was used for data storage, allowing for a flexible and efficient data structure. Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, was employed to facilitate interactions with the MongoDB database, while also providing schema validation and query building features.

During the project's development, several challenges were encountered, such as ensuring proper data validation and handling errors effectively. This required the implementation of custom validation logic and error handling middleware to provide meaningful feedback to the API consumers. Another issue faced was maintaining referential integrity between the user, thought, and reaction entities, which was addressed by employing Mongoose's built-in relationship management tools and carefully crafting update and delete operations to keep data consistent.

Through resolving these challenges, the project resulted in a fully functional Social Network API, allowing users to create, update, and delete their profiles, as well as add and remove friends. Users could also post thoughts, react to others' thoughts, and manage their reactions. The API supported pagination and sorting, making it scalable and efficient for handling large volumes of data.

Throughout the development process, valuable lessons were learned, including best practices in API design, working with the Express framework, and understanding the intricacies of MongoDB and Mongoose. Additionally, the project emphasized the importance of thorough testing and debugging, using tools such as Insomnia and MongoDB Compass to verify the functionality and performance of the API endpoints. Overall, the Social Network API project was a successful endeavor, demonstrating the power and flexibility of Node.js, Express, and MongoDB in creating modern and scalable web applications.
